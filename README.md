## Problem Statement :

Welcome to an exciting project where planet Earth faces an imminent threat from invading aliens! These extraterrestrial beings are determined to conquer Earth, but there’s a glimmer of hope: They’ve challenged us to a high-stakes T20 cricket match. The fate of humanity rests on the shoulders of the “BEST 11” cricket team we assemble to take on the Alien 11.

## Requirement Scoping :
To ensure a fair and thrilling contest, we’ve established specific parameters to select the BEST 11 players for our team. To achieve this, we have followed the below parameters.

## Key Steps:
  ## 1.Web Scraping Data from ESPN Cricinfo:

  • Utilized the third-party web scraper "Bright Data" to effectively gather information from the ESPN Cricinfo website, including match data, results, player batting data, and bowling     data.
   
  •The scraped data was stored in the form of JSON for further processing.

## 2.Data Transformation and Conversion:

  • Leveraged Python and Pandas to transform the JSON data into CSV format.
  
  • Ensured the data was in a suitable format to be directly used in Power BI, simplifying the process of joining tables.

## 3.Power BI Dashboard Creation:

  • Utilized Power Query in Power BI to further transform and clean the data for analysis.
  
  • Created dynamic dashboards with interactive charts and visualizations, presenting measures for various aspects, such as power hitters, middle-order batsmen, and bowlers.

  • These dashboards provided valuable insights into player performance, team strengths, and areas of improvement.
    
## 4.Forming the Best Playing 11:

  • Applied data-driven analysis and decision-making techniques to form the best playing 11 based on the requirements and insights obtained from the dashboard.
  
  • The combined playing 11 was determined to optimize team performance and increase the chances of success in the ICC Cricket World Cup 2022.

## 5.Technologies Used:

  • Web Scraping: Bright Data (Third-party Web Scraper)
  
  • Programming Language: Python
  
  • Data Manipulation: Pandas
  
  • Data Visualization: Power BI
